The additional challenge I chose was the options to save your story to a file. This option sparked my interest because I remember learning about it in training earlier and wanted to gain more practice using this feature.
It is beneficial because it allows users to save the progress they have made to come back to it later.
The most interesting part of my chosen feauture is input option. It is cool to interact with the programs I create when I'm asked to type in an input.
The greatest obstacle I faced when adding this feature is remembering that curly braces go into f strings. I overcame this obstacle by going back over my notes and then referring to ChatGPT for a more detailed explanation on f string's structure.
Branch and merge allowed me to quickly transfer my original and updated versions of the program I was working on to Github without having to spend time switching screens to do so.
I am more comfortable with conditionals and loops after completing this activity, I will work on the ones I'm not so comfortable with during the week.
