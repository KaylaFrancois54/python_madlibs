# Answer the following questions:

# 1. which python function did you use to get user input?

#    - I used the `input()` function to get user input.

# 2. How did f-string formatting help in constructing the story?

#   - F-string formatting allowed me to easily insert the user inputs into the story template by using curly braces `{}` within the string. This made the code cleaner and more readable.

# 3. what would you change or add to your script if you wanted to make the game more interactive?

# - I would add loop to allowe the user to play multiple rounds without restarting the script.
